- Cells from Arabidopsis roots expressing a gradient marker emanating from the distal root tip were sorted[^Iyer-Pascuzzi and Benfey, 2010] based on GFP intensity and separated into three different populations (proximal, medial, and distal correspond to high, medium, and low GFP intensity) for up to three biological replicates.
- Total RNA was extracted from 20,000 to 50,000 cells and 10 ng was amplified using an Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 (NuGEN).
- 3 µg of amplified cDNA was fragmented to ~200 bp and Illumina RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Ovation Ultralow Library Systems (NuGEN).
- RNA-Seq data (Illumina HiSeq, 50 bp Single End) were analyzed using the Bowtie/Tophat/Cufflinks package and differentially expressed genes were determined.
- Expression values (FPKM: Fragments Per Kilobase Per Million Mapped Fragments) and fold changes (log2) are shown. 
  Differences with q-values < 0.05 are considered significant.
