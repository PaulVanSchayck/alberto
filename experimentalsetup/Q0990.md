- ARFs are inhibited in the inner embryo proper cells of early Q0990>>bdl embryos.
- 300-400 globular stage and heart stage Q0990>>bdl and wild-type embryos were microdissected from plants grown under 
  at a constant temperature of 22° under long-day conditions (16 hours light/8 hours dark).
- RNA samples representing four biological replicates were extracted, amplified, labelled (two cy3 and two cy5) and 
  hybridized to microarray slides following the protocol described in http://ag.arizona.edu/microarray. 
- The Arabidopsis 70-mer oligo array slides prepared by University of Arizona were used in all the microarray 
  experiments (version ATV 3.7.2; http://ag.arizona.edu/microarray/). 
- Limma Software[^Smyth 2004] was used to normalize expression values (signal intensities) and to determine the modulated genes from microarray data. 
- SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays[^Tusher et al. 2001]) was used to evaluate differentially expressed genes. 
  Fold changes (log2) > 0.58 or < -0.58 with q-values < 0.05 are regarded as significant.
