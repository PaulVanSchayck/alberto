These images have been created by Colette Ten Hove and Kuan-Ju Lu.

Notes
-----

The following should be noted when making new images:

* The groups with a tissue ID should be the ones setting the fill attribute for all sub groups.
* Set the width and height of an image to 300px, this is required for the PNG export.

Optimization
------------

The optimized images have been created using the default optimize options of Inkscape

TODO: Do formal optimization using svgo, as we need to remove namespaces as well.
