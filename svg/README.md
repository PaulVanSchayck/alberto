These images have been created by Colette Ten Hove and Kuan-Ju Lu.

Notes
-----

The following should be noted when making new images:

* The groups with a tissue class should be the ones setting the fill attribute for all sub groups.
* The top level SVG element should contain proper width and height attributes, this is required for the PNG export.
* The top level SVG element should not contain any custom namespace (attributes with : in it) for the SVG export to work in IE.

Optimization
------------

The optimized images have been created using the default optimize options of Inkscape

TODO: Do formal optimization using svgo, as we need to remove namespaces as well.
